Prepare from GeeksforGeeks


First your main target should be to clear Product based Company Interview and not go for Service Sector Company

By Product Based Company --Now is the time to work hard and earn BIG---Target is December 2016


By Service Sector Company you should be a good UI Developer and Java Developer Knowing Everything that's in use

Spring Framework --Everything that is there in industry right now

Products Based Company Links ----

http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/#LinkedList
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/


Read Experience everyday to get motivated

http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/about/interview-corner/


What ever you learn from blog share it in the blog and share it on github Code for Review with proper Comments and everything that's possible


You should read the latest problems that is solved by amazon and microsoft and how they solved them . You should also be solving daily software problems faced and how to deal with them

For Though Works your problem solving approach should be good enough so that you can deal with the problem efficiently .
Just go throught the Interview Experience so far

Try to participate in every contest held in hackerrank and hackerearth and learn from them your level


As a UI Developer you should be focused in learning AngularJS ..You should be focused in learning Angular 2 and participate in Challenges for mobile app Development

Try to develop some awesome Mobile Apps in Ionic 2 and Angular 2


Don't get away from NodeJS and Java Spring Framework for Development of REST Services

Try to learn Some Industry Standards and how they implement it
As an experience developer you should be a ninja Developer ---Web Full Stack plus Mobile App Development (Hybrid App Development)

Try to get one laptop from Office so that you can learn Java Technology Easily --just get it tag under you wisely or cleverly under you --most important --you can learn Java and Android also by this

Try getting Release --get it if you dont get release


Try switching ---- If dont get release then go for it --get a job in other stable Company and resign stating that you didnt got the project which you wanted


You worked for 1 year in support that is more then enough --fight for it now

try freelancing earn something which can give you better money and better bank balance no need to ask for any help or to tell anyone about this .

YOU EXIST AS INDIVIDUAL THO SHALL ACHIEVE INDIVIDUALLY




Research Results from Coding Questions


https://www.interviewbit.com -----Prepare from here its cool to learn

https://www.careercup.com/ ---This is also cool to see what companies ask in Coding Interviews

few interesting puzzles and maths problems  ------this is also important for clearing Interview ---geeksforgeeks is preferred here



What you need to have during the interview:-


    First and foremost Confidence
    Ability to stay calm always.
    Finding edge corner cases in your questions.
    Conversation with interviewer regarding the problem and what you are thinking. Try to define the scope of the problem and understand the question problem.
    Coding/Scripting in one particular language should be strong.
    Start with worst algo if possible and then improve.
    Not saying I cannot do it please help me(you should never do that), they want to see how you think so yeah THINK.


Some Other Tips from other place


Focus on following areas:

Data structures: Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Hash Table, BST, Map (Hash vs Tree), Set, Trie & Graph. Understand “cost” of various operations like add, delete, modify, search, sort, traverse, etc. Know pros and cons of each data structure and what type of data they are good at representing.

Algorithms: Read up as many algorithms as you can. Pay close attention to how they overcome the cons of data structures (if any) and exploit the pros of data structures and any special attributes of data to find efficient solutions.

Maths: Brush up maths! It has a much bigger role to play than it appears in coding interviews. By this time you will be good at problem solving. You will know how to break down an unknown problem into similar and/or smaller known problems. Pick some popular book(s) on coding interviews to know which maths topics are relevant.

Coding: Practise writing elegant, correct and efficient code that is easy to read and explain within 25-45 minutes.

Tips for coding interviews:

    ask relevant questions before attempting to solve
    break the problem into similar/smaller known problems
    briefly discuss brute force approach, if required
    where applicable, use

    math
    sorting
    searching
    traversal
    recursion
    bit manipulation
    dynamic programming

    before implementing your algorithm

    discuss it with the interviewer
    discuss it’s time and space complexity
    see if it can be improved based on above discussion

    write test cases (before code!)
    start small, test immediately
    write functions that are

    reusable
    loosely coupled
    small and do only one thing!

    avoid

    gotos
    unnecessary variables
    unnecessary/many/nested if-elses

    always

    validate input
    check return codes
    handle corner cases
    trace your code with test cases before telling the interviewer - done!



Just read this experience every time when you want to prepare for Coding Interview

http://www.mohsinali.net/guide.html

This is 15th November. I will complete each of my algorithm before 25th November at any cost.

you have the Nitin Code . you can kick start from there onwards

Implement Every Algorithm from start to top

Dynamic Programming can only learn by practicing and Practice

There is no alternative except to practice --Recursive formula plus Memorization

Trie Data Structure is also important

you need to understand how recursion works and how you can calculate complexity from this
CareerCode website is must for it

InterviewBit is also Necessary for Interview Preparation (People go to CISCO for that)

I will start with

1. DFS
2. BFS
3. Djikstra
4. Minimum Spanning Tree

Slowly start with tree also and implement it also

Complete Merge Sort and Other Recursive Algorithm also and complete it Complexity


Need Parallel practice from Tushar Roy Github link

https://github.com/mission-peace/interview/

You should learn algorithm from geeksforgeeks and tushar roy both

Plus practice it from

HackerEarth
https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/

HackerRank

University Course Notes

Mathematics for Competitive Programming

Off the top of my head, here are some mathematical topics I encountered in programming competitions:

    Modular arithmetic, extended Euclid, Euler's totient function, Moebius function, Binomical coefficients, Bernoulli numbers, linear diophantine equations
    Matrices, Gauss algorithm
    Discrete probabilities, linearity of expectation, probability of conjunction of independent variables, distribution of order statistics.
    Combinatorics, rule of sum/product, inclusion/exclusion principle, Burnside lemma, Gray code, Catalan numbers
    Simple analitycal geometry (line intersection, line/circle intersection, inscribed circle), convex hull.
    Recurrence relations, linear recurrences
    Polynomials, fast Fourier transform
    Hall's marriage theorem, Menger's theorem (graph problems in general tend to be math-heavy)
