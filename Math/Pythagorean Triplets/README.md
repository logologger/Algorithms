<p>

		There are two logics to this Question either Iterate Directly three times to find that pair by generating each and every pair

	Second Approach is to sort the squared array and then apply meet in the middle technique for that <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-c-program-that-given-a-set-a-of-n-numbers-and-another-number-x-determines-whether-or-not-there-exist-two-elements-in-s-whose-sum-is-exactly-x/"> Link</a>


	Another Approach is using Hash Map for finding the sum ...Its in the above link only
